For example, to filter for resources that have a tag key of ‚Äúpurpose‚Äù and value of ‚Äúproduction‚Äù (purpose=production), enter ‚Äúpurpose: production‚Äù. \n\nIf the tag key includes a colon, you must escape the colon with a backslash (\\). For example, to filter for resources that have a tag key of ‚Äúteam:owner‚Äù and a value of ‚Äúdevteam‚Äù (team:owner=devteam), enter ‚Äúteam\\:owner: devteam‚Äù. \n\nYou can also use the ‚Äú*‚Äù and ‚Äú?‚Äù wildcards in your filters. ‚Äú?‚Äù is a single character wildcard that matches zero or one character. ‚Äú*‚Äù is a multiple character wildcard that matches one or more characters. For example, if you have the following tags: ‚Äúpurpose=prod‚Äù, ‚Äúpurpose=prods‚Äù, and ‚Äúpurpose=production‚Äù, then ‚Äúpurpose: prod*‚Äù would match all of the tags, and ‚Äúpurpose: prod?‚Äù would match only ‚Äúpurpose=prod‚Äù and ‚Äúpurpose=prods‚Äù."
